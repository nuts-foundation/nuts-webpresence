# A decentralised infrastructure for healthcare

Nuts is a fresh look at an old problem. Nuts is the realisation that the way
medical data is currently being shared is pretty crazy.

And Nuts is a collaboration of organisations that believe it is time for shared
facilities ("Nutsvoorzieningen" in Dutch), a network built by anyone for
everyone. The necessary infrastructure to communicate medical data in the
primary care process.

Because it really is possible to work together using computers instead of fax
machines in healthcare. And it's possible to do so safely, securely and with no
extra costs.

## Connection Procedure

The procedure to become a Nuts participant with a current connection agreement is as follows:

Review the current version of the connection agreement. You can download the connection agreement [here](/assets/downloads/aansluitovereenkomst-nuts-english.pdf). 

If in agreement, send an email to info@nuts.nl with the following information:
<li>Name of the organization as registered with the Chamber of Commerce (KvK).</li>
<li>Chamber of Commerce (KvK) number of the organization.</li>
<li>Organization's website.</li>
<li>Contact information (phone numbers) of one or more authorized signatories, as requested in the agreement under "parties." (Email addresses must match the domain name of the organization's website.)</li>
<li>Include the email addresses of these authorized signatories in the cc field of the email.</li><br>

The Nuts foundation will contact the authorized signatory(ies) for verification.
Subsequently, an invitation will be sent to these email addresses via Docusign to digitally sign the agreement.
After everyone has digitally signed the agreement, your organization will be added to the list of participants with a current connection agreement with the Nuts Foundation.

If you have any questions, please contact info@nuts.nl.
