# Utility (Nuts) service for digital collaboration across the entire healthcare sector.
# Nuts a decentralised infrastructure for healthcare
Nuts (utility service means Nutsvoorziening in Dutch) enables software applications in healthcare to communicate. Join and become part of a network for everyone and by everyone. This allows you to reach both the local pharmacy around the corner and the hospital in Helsinki. Nuts is a collaboration of organisations that believe it is time for shared
facilities, a network built by anyone for everyone. The necessary infrastructure to communicate medical data in the primary care process.
Because it really is possible to work together using computers instead of fax machines in healthcare. And it's possible to do so safely, securely and with no
extra costs.

## Nuts Mission
The mission of the Nuts community is to provide a utility service to the healthcare sector to enhance information sharing in healthcare and support optimal collaboration. A utility service for the common good by leveraging international open standards, open specifications, and an open-source software reference implementation in the form of source code and a utility node for everyone and, as a result, also by everyone. For the common good, and that is also what the Nuts community aims for.

Open-source means that the source code is accessible to everyone, preventing any monopoly from being created on the Nuts specification or the Nuts node. The software license (Creative Commons) ensures that the reference implementation is available at no cost, both now and in the future.

## What does Nuts do?
Nuts develops and manages a utility service that enables the sharing of healthcare-related information over the Internet in a confidential, secure, and accessible manner. With the aim of facilitating digital collaboration throughout the healthcare sector - and thus improving healthcare.

Nuts is organized as a community and a foundation. Nuts is supported and driven by a diverse group of forward-thinking individuals and organizations who, in the common interest, seek to make a positive impact on the (digital) healthcare landscape. We are guided by a shared manifesto. We design, specify, and build necessary building blocks for data exchange in healthcare. Because only through action can we truly make an impact."
