# A decentralised infrastructure for healthcare

Nuts is a fresh look at an old problem. Nuts is the realisation that the way
medical data is currently being shared is pretty crazy.

And Nuts is a collaboration of organisations that believe it is time for shared
facilities ("Nutsvoorzieningen" in Dutch), a network built by anyone for
everyone. The necessary infrastructure to communicate medical data in the
primary care process.

Because it really is possible to work together using computers instead of fax
machines in healthcare. And it's possible to do so safely, securely and with no
extra costs.

## Care to know more?

We are currently focussing on the Dutch healthcare market. So the English part
of this website is pretty empty, and will be for the foreseeable future. You can
try [browsing our Dutch website through Google translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=nl&tl=en&u=nuts.nl)
or you can [contact us]({{ 'contact' }}) if you would like to know more or join
our cause!

## For developers

Our [Github](https://github.com/nuts-foundation) organisation and our
[technical documentation](https://nuts-node.readthedocs.io/) are both
in English!
